> ⚠️ Make sure to set up the `.env` file.  
> .env file must contain **MONGODB_URI** and **PORT**  
> Kindly note : If you want to run on your own backend, then you will have to change the api calls in frontend to your custom api
```bash
cd backend        # Move to backend folder
npm install       # Install required dependencies
node index.js     # Start backend server on specified PORT in .env file (https://localhost:PORT)
 
cd ..             # Move back to root folder
cd frontend       # Move to frontend folder
npm install       # Install required dependencies
npm run dev       # Start frontend on port 5173 (https://localhost:5173)
```
